Optimal Private Minimum Spanning Trees using Output Perturbation
==================


Experiments with Privately Releasing Minimum Spanning Trees

Getting Started
--------
We use the following environment to run the experiments.
Requirements are stored inside requirements.txt:


.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/priv-mst
    source ~/.virtualenvs/priv-mst/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirememts.txt


Also feel free to use the environment in the IDE of your choice
